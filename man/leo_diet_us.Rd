\description{
Calculate a 0–7 healthy diet score using seven components (vegetables, fruit,
fish, whole grains, refined grains, processed meat, unprocessed meat) following
the U.S. Dietary Guidelines targets. Each component meeting its intake target
contributes 1 point; higher scores indicate healthier patterns.
}
\details{
Field expectations (UKB instance 0):
\itemize{
\item Fruits: p1309_i0 (fresh pieces/day), p1319_i0 (dried pieces/day; 5 pieces = 1 serving)
\item Vegetables: p1289_i0 (cooked tablespoons/day), p1299_i0 (salad tablespoons/day; 3 tbsp = 1 serving)
\item Fish: p1329_i0 (oily fish frequency code), p1339_i0 (non-oily fish frequency code)
\item Bread: p1438_i0 (slices/week, -10 = "less than once"), p1448_i0 (type: 1=White, 2=Brown, 3=Wholemeal, 4=Other)
\item Cereal: p1458_i0 (bowls/week, -10 = "less than once"), p1468_i0 (type: 1=Bran, 2=Biscuit, 3=Oat, 4=Muesli, 5=Other)
\item Processed meat: p1349_i0 (frequency code 0–5, per Data-Coding 100377); p3680_i0 == 0 implies never ate meat
\item Unprocessed meat: p1359_i0 (poultry), p1369_i0 (beef), p1379_i0 (lamb), p1389_i0 (pork) — all frequency codes 0–5
}

All frequency fields (100377) encode: 0=Never, 1=<1/wk, 2=1/wk, 3=2–4/wk, 4=5–6/wk, 5=Daily.
To meet component thresholds, frequency codes must be converted to weekly servings
(e.g., code 2 → 1/wk, code 3 → 3/wk midpoint, code 5 → 7/wk).

Whole grains: bread_type==3 (wholemeal) + cereal_type in (1,3,4) (bran/oat/muesli)
Refined grains: bread_type in (1,2,4) (white/brown/other) + cereal_type in (2,5) (biscuit/other)
}
