# LEO·UKB

`leo.ukb` is an internal toolkit for working with UK Biobank (UKB) data.
It provides a small set of helper functions that streamline common
workflows—field parsing/decoding, format conversion, batch processing,
and preparing analysis-ready datasets—for large-scale biomedical
studies.

> **Note**: This package is intended for academic research purposes. The
> code functionalities are experimental and subject to change.
